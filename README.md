The main functionalities of the project include:


- **Scanning the Kubernetes cluster**: The tool scans the cluster to identify the deployed pods, services, and deployments. It retrieves information about the tools used in the cluster and their rankings.
- **Detecting tools from the repository**: The tool detects the tools used in the cluster by analyzing the names of the pods and deployments.
- **Extracting rankings**: The tool extracts the rankings of the detected tools based on predefined criteria. It categorizes the tools into different categories and provides the rankings for each category.
- **Generating recommendations**: The tool generates recommendations for Kubernetes tools based on the detected tools and their rankings. It suggests the best tools for each category and compares them with the tools already used in the cluster.
- **Health check**: The tool provides a health check for a selected pod in the cluster. It extracts logs and events from the pod and analyzes them using a language model (LLM) to identify potential issues and provide recommendations for resolving them.
- **Exporting pod information**: The tool exports the information about the pods, services, and deployments in the cluster to a JSON file.
- **Cleaning up**: The tool provides an option to clean up the project's data directory by deleting all files and directories within it.
- **Model**: Supports OpenAI and Hugging Face models

## How does it work?

<img width="1146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e415db6d-5aff-4ea5-92f7-59f37a353d6f">


The project uses various Python libraries, such as typer, requests, kubernetes, tabulate, and pickle, to accomplish its functionalities. 
It also utilizes a language model (LLM) for the health check feature. 
The project's directory structure and package management are managed using requirements.txt. 
The project's data, such as tool rankings, CNCF status, and Kubernetes cluster information, are stored in JSON files and pickled files.

>>
```

The user is prompted to choose a model provider for the health check. 
The options provided are "OpenAI" and "Huggingface". The selected option determines which LLM model will be used for the health check.

Let's say you choose the option "1", then it will install the necessary libraries.


```
Enter your OpenAI API key: sk-3iXXXXXTpTyyOq2mR

Enter the OpenAI model name: gpt-3.5-turbo
API key and model are valid.

Namespaces in the cluster:

1. default
2. kube-node-lease

>>  Warning/Error 1:
"Unable to authenticate the request" with err="[invalid bearer token, service account token has expired]"
This indicates that there was an issue with authenticating the request due to an invalid bearer token and an expired service account token. To resolve this issue, the bearer token needs to be updated or regenerated, and the service account token needs to be renewed.

Warning/Error 2:
"Failed to update lease" with err="StorageError: invalid object, Code: 4, Key: /registry/leases/kube-system/apiserver-457xdkumpkdqmkwikdt6khrbya"
This error indicates a storage error while trying to update a lease, possibly due to an invalid object or a conflict in UIDs. To resolve this issue, the lease object needs to be checked and possibly recreated with the correct UID.

Warning/Error 3:
"Error removing old endpoints from kubernetes service: no API server IP addresses were listed in storage, refusing to erase all endpoints for the kubernetes Service"
This warning indicates that there were no API server IP addresses listed in storage, causing the removal of old endpoints from the Kubernetes service to fail. To resolve this issue, the API server IP addresses need to be correctly listed in storage.

Warning/Error 4:
"Skipping API apps/v1beta1 because it has no resources."
This warning indicates that the API version 'apps/v1beta1' is being skipped because it has no associated resources. This might be an informational warning and may not necessarily require immediate action, depending on the use case.

Warning/Error 5:
"watch chan error: etcdserver: mvcc: required revision has been compacted"
This error indicates a watch channel error related to the revision being compacted in etcdserver. To resolve this issue, the etcd database revision or configuration may need to be checked and potentially adjusted.

Overall, it is important to investigate and address each warning and error to ensure the stability and reliability of the Kubernetes cluster. If there are no concerns in the log entries provided, the message 'Everything looks good!' can be returned.

>> can you help me in fixing this error message
>>  To help you fix the error messages mentioned in the log entries, here are some steps you can take:

1. For the "Unable to authenticate the request" error:
   - Generate a new bearer token and update it in the relevant configuration files.
   - Renew the service account token to prevent expiration issues.

2. For the "Failed to update lease" error:
   - Investigate the storage error and check for any invalid objects.
   - Recreate the lease object with the correct UID if needed.

3. For the "Error removing old endpoints from Kubernetes service" error:
   - Ensure that the API server IP addresses are correctly listed in the storage.
   - Verify the configuration of the Kubernetes service and update it if necessary.

4. For the "watch chan error: etcdserver: mvcc: required revision has been compacted" error:
   - Check the etcd server configuration and ensure that the revision is maintained correctly.
   - Monitor the etcd server for any potential issues causing revision compaction.

After performing these steps, restart relevant services or components as needed to apply the changes. Monitor the Kubernetes cluster for any further errors and ensure that the issues have been resolved successfully.

Feel free to provide more specific details or additional logs if you need further assistance with resolving the error messages.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary> How safe is Krs for Prod environment</summary>

The tool is designed to be a non-invasive tool that provides insights into the current state of a Kubernetes cluster without making any changes to the cluster itself. It does not store any sensitive data or credentials, and it only retrieves information from the cluster and external data sources.
